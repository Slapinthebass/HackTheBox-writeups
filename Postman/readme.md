# Summary

This was a pretty good box. I had to perform full port scan on this box which took more time then total exploiting does.

In this I used a know redis vulnerability to get a shell as `redis` user and then exploited `webmin` to get root shell and flag.

# Enumeration

## NMAP

![](images/nmap.png)

Let's start our enumeration with HTTP services.

### HTTP

On port 80 I found a very simple website running

The website didn't had anything else. Also gobuster didn't found any suspicious directory. So I decided to look at port `10000` which was running a `webmin 1.910`.

I used searchsploit to find the exploits. There were few but none of them seemed to work. Then I realized I've missed a full port scan. so then I decided to run nmap again but with `-p-`(took sometime) but then I found another port opened.

We can see that there is a redis server running on port `6379`.

## Exploiting Redis

I googled for exploits related to redis and found [Redis-Remote-Command-Execution](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/134200/Redis-Remote-Command-Execution.html). I followed the instruction mentioned in the post and I was able to get a ssh connection using `redis` account.

I tried to read the user.txt but I wasn't allowed to do so. I kept looking around and found `ssh private` key for user `Matt` in `/opt`.

But when I tried to login with that key I was asked for `passphrase`.
I tried to crack the password with `ssh2john`.

```bash
> ssh2john keyz > hash.txt
> john hash.txt
```

`computer2008`

I tried to ssh with that passphrase but kept getting `connection lost`.

Since I was not able to directly SSH as `matt` I decided to do `su matt` and it worked.

## Privilege Escalation

I tried to enumerate using enumeration script but couldn't find anything. Then I realized there was `webmin` on port 10000 and we found lot of exploit for it. So I decided to try `linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce` from metasploit with the following options

This gave me shell as `root`. And this actually worked because this time I had `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`.
